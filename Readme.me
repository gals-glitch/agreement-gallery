## Executive Summary

Purpose: consolidate the meeting requests and provide a plan to deliver an internal Investor Overview dashboard for IR prep—PDF export immediately, interactivity/sharing later.

### Meeting Requests

**Data & Calculations**
- Connect to Vantage for investments, cash flows, balances/valuations.
- Compute/aggregate NAV; show Missing/Stale NAV indicators.
- Surface Net Cash + Equity (noting mock data until final mapping lands).
- Sector-level returns deferred until data quality confirmed.
- Display investment rating if supplied; otherwise document placeholder.

**Time Ranges & Filters**
- Quick picks: 3/5/10/12 years, 2025 (current year), Custom.
- Option to view full history since investor onboarded.

**Breakdowns & Visuals**
- Sector & country breakdowns (pie + table).
- Portfolio allocation pie (phase 1 static, later interactive slices).
- Annual blocks per year: inflows (contributions) vs outflows (distributions).

**UX & Sharing**
- Investor name search loads a one-pager overview.
- PDF export for printing/internal send.
- MVP = internal use only; secure sharing (tokenized links/SSO) later.
- Explicit security caveats until sharing hardened.

### Phased Delivery Plan

**MVP (2 weeks)**  
- Investor picker, overview card (Equity, Net Cash, NAV status).  
- Sector/country pies & tables.  
- Annual contributions vs distributions blocks.  
- Date filters 3/5/10/12/All/Custom.  
- PDF export (title, timestamp, investor info, disclaimer).

**V1 (Weeks 3–4)**  
- DQ checks, anomaly highlighting, investment rating placeholder.  
- Layered caching (Contacts/Account mappings 15m, Financials 5m, Cash Flows 1m).  
- Basic diagnostics/log screen.

**V1.5 (Weeks 5–6)**  
- Interactive pie drill-downs; richer timeline (quarter/month) if data allows.  
- Security groundwork: SSO/tokenized links, rate limiting, audit trail (still internal only).

### Screens & Components
- Investor Search (typeahead, recents).  
- Investor Overview (KPIs, date controls).  
- Sector Breakdown (pie + table).  
- Country Breakdown (pie + table).  
- Annual Timeline (yearly In vs Out).  
- Exceptions/Alerts (Missing/Stale NAV, unslotted sector/country, negative/dup sums).  
- PDF Export (logo, report title, range, timestamp, disclaimer).

### Calculation Definitions
- Net Cash = Σ(Contributions) − Σ(Distributions).
- Equity = summed NAV (show “Missing NAV” when data absent).
- NAV = Vantage valuations only (no bespoke modeling in MVP).
- Annual In/Out use consistent value-date rules.
- Sector returns remain out of scope until data allows standardized IRR/TVPI.

### Data Integration (Vantage)
- Pulls: Contacts, Holdings/Commitments, Cash Flows, Valuations, Geography, Sectors/Tags.
- Mapping: Investor → Holdings/Commitments → Cash Flows → Valuations.
- DQ: reconcile cash flows vs annual aggregates; flag missing sector/country; flag stale NAV beyond threshold.

### Security & Permissions
- MVP: internal-only access, audit logs for fetch/export.
- Next: secure share links (tokenized + expiry), SSO, rate limiting.

### Export & Print
- One/two-page PDF with pies, timeline, key tables.
- Disclaimer: “For internal IR prep; NAV values may be partial/non-final.”
- Timestamp + investor ID on every export.

### Timeline & Milestones (UTC+2)
- Sprint 0 (Nov 5–7): connectivity, schema definitions, skeleton UI/PDF.
- Sprint 1 (Nov 9–14): data aggregations, pies, annual timeline, PDF sample.
- Sprint 2 (Nov 16–21): missing/stale NAV indicators, anomaly log, caching, KPIs.
- Sprint 3 (Nov 23–28): pie drill-downs, diagnostics/logs, PDF parity.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Search & load <2s with cache; show name/ID/#investments.
- Sector/country pies total 100%; later slices drill down.
- Annual timeline sums match cash-flow aggregates.
- KPIs show Equity/Net Cash for range; NAV status visible.
- PDF mirrors UI, includes disclaimers/timestamps.
- Security: external access blocked; audit logging enabled.

### Risks & Dependencies
- Data gaps (sector/country) → remediation reports.
- Missing NAV → highlight; avoid performance claims without valuations.
- Performance → manage via caching/pagination.
- Security → keep internal-only until sharing hardened.

### Appendix
- **Vantage Fields**: investors (id/name/status), holdings (sector/country/commitment/cost/NAV), cash flows (date/type/amount), lookups (sectors/countries/tags), derived metrics (Net Cash, Equity, NAV status).
- **PDF Disclaimer**: “This document is for internal use to prepare investor meetings. NAV data may be partial/non-final. This is not investment advice.”
